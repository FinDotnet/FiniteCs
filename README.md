### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# About me
- My name is **Fin**. I am a .Net Developer, I develope client side applications in C#. 

- I am currently learning C#, CIL, and C++.

- In my free time, I like to expand my knowlage on compilers, and compiler theories.

- I am currently in the begining stages of developing a compiler for my own statically typed language, that if all goes well, will compile to CIL so it can be ran on the CLR.

# Future plans
- I do plan on eventually learning server sided things as I currently have no knowlage on this.
